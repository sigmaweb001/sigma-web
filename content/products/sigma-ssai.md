HIGHLIGHTS FEATURES

::section-normal
By integrating content and ads into one continuous stream, SSAI provides a seamless viewing experience, similar to a traditional advertising break. We offers SSAI technology that makes it possible to exchange and insert TV spots on the fly, so broadcasters can increase yield from linear streams within OTT and web environments.

![ssai-how-it-work-2.png](/ssai/ssai-how-it-work-2.png)
Users stream video or OTT content on internet-enabled devices via content delivery networks (CDNs). When a user reaches an ad break, the SSAI server requests ads from third-party ad servers. The SSAI server then stitches those ads – at the same bitrate, frame rate and audio level as the underlying stream – directly into the content, which is passed back to the viewing device via the CDN.
