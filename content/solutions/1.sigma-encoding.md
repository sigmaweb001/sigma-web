  As demand for video grows, get an edge on the competition

  #subtitle
  You probably already know that no two videos are the same. Furthermore, each video has a wide variety of scenes that would benefit from specific encoding settings to maximize visual quality, while keeping file sizes as small as possible. The limitations of encoding technology often require engineers to use the same encoding settings for each video, preventing the full realization of video quality and delivery performance potential. And with viewers across the world with limited access to internet bandwidth, the consequences of a fixed settings can deprive a large number of your users from the video experience we all deserve.
