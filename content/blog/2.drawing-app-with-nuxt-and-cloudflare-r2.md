## Introduction

I won't go into each detail of the code, but I'll try to explain the main concepts and how to build a drawing app with Nuxt and Cloudflare R2.

Atidraw is a web application that lets you create and share your drawings with the world. Our app uses OAuth for user authentication and Cloudflare R2 to store and list drawings.

The application runs with server-side rendering on the edge using Cloudflare Pages on the Workers free plan.
