We all live in a world where accessing and consuming online content has become more common than ever. With the advancement of technology, Video on Demand (VOD) has become an essential part of our daily lives. It is a powerful tool that allows us to watch shows, movies, educational videos, and entertainment content instantly, anytime, anywhere, without being dependent on traditional TV schedules.

## What is VOD?

 VOD (Video on Demand) is an interactive multimedia system that allows users to choose and watch videos at their convenience, similar to watching a DVD. Users can pause, rewind, or watch videos according to their personal needs. This provides complete autonomy, enabling users to select content and request transmission based on their personal preferences. VOD is like having a private rental service, giving users control over what and when to watch.

Currently, in Vietnam, Thủ Đô Multimedia is a leading provider of VOD solutions, trusted by many partners. Sigma Media VOD, provided by Thủ Đô Multimedia, is a comprehensive online video storage and distribution solution that offers many powerful features to meet your needs.

Below are some standout features:

### **1.** Powerful Transcoding Process

 **Transcoding** is the process of converting a video format into another format. The transcoding feature of the Sigma Media VOD system allows you to convert videos into formats supported by the system and optimize them for streaming.

  There are many different video formats currently available, including MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, etc. The Sigma Media VOD system must support all the above input file formats and output in various formats like HLS, DASH, MP4, etc., optimized for different platforms like smartphones, computers, TVs, etc.

### **2. Simulated Live Stream from Pre-recorded Content**

Simulated live streaming from pre-recorded content is a feature that allows viewers to interact with VOD content as if they were watching a live broadcast. The VOD content is pre-recorded and broadcasted at the same pace as a live stream, allowing viewers to comment, ask questions, and receive real-time feedback.

Advantages of Simulated Live Stream from Pre-recorded Content:

  **Cost Savings:** Compared to actual live streaming, simulated live streaming from pre-recorded content significantly reduces production, equipment, and labor costs.

  **Tight Content Control:** Producers can edit and review content before broadcasting, ensuring quality and suitability for the target audience.

  **Extended Reach:** VOD content can be broadcast across multiple platforms, reaching a broader audience.

  **Enhanced Interaction:** Viewers can not only passively watch content but also participate in the conversation, creating a more vibrant and engaging experience.

  **On-Demand Viewing:** Viewers can watch the "simulated live" broadcast anytime they want, without being restricted by broadcast schedules.

###  ​​**3.** Watch Folder Feature

The watch folder feature in the Sigma Media VOD system allows you to automatically transcode videos without manual intervention. This feature works by monitoring a folder on your server and automatically transcoding any new video files stored in that folder. It saves time and effort for system administrators by automating the transcoding of new content.

### **4.** Support for Third-Party Video Storage

Allows you to store videos on cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.

 For VOD service providers, using third-party video storage has the following advantages:

  **Infrastructure Cost Reduction:** Storing videos on third-party cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage helps VOD providers save on infrastructure investment and operating costs. They do not need to invest in servers, hard drives, network systems, or personnel to manage storage infrastructure.

  **High Scalability:** Third-party cloud storage services are highly scalable, allowing for easy expansion or reduction of storage capacity based on the needs of the VOD provider. This helps them meet the increasing storage demand without additional infrastructure investment.

  **High Reliability:** Third-party cloud storage services offer high reliability, ensuring the safety of VOD provider's video data. They use multiple data centers in different regions to back up data, minimizing the risk of data loss due to hardware or software failures.

  **Easy Management:** Third-party cloud storage services provide user-friendly management tools, making it easy for VOD providers to manage their video data. They can monitor storage capacity, access data from anywhere, and delete data when no longer needed.

### **5.** Analytics Tool

  The analytics tool aggregates information about the transcoding process, such as the number of videos transcoded, successful transcodes, failed transcodes, and transcoding time. This information helps identify any failed video transcodes, allowing for re-transcoding.

### **6.** Conclusion

 With flexible utilities, interactive capabilities, and diverse content offerings, VOD is not only entertaining but also holds great potential in areas like education, business, and marketing. All these benefits and opportunities open up a brighter, more convenient, and highly promising future with the Video on Demand model.
